# Data Preprocessing and Project Setup for GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION PREDICTION

## Overview
This work includes data preprocessing and preparation steps as part of a larger machine learning or data analysis workflow. The dataset was initially stored in Excel sheets and has been cleaned and organized for further use.

## Steps Completed
1. **Excel Sheet Extraction**  
   Extracted individual sheets from Excel files.

2. **Conversion to CSV**  
   Converted all relevant Excel sheets into CSV format for compatibility and ease of processing.

3. **Data Cleaning (Weka Tool)**  
   Used Weka to clean the dataset by removing missing values and ensuring consistency.

4. **Data Organization**  
   Organized the cleaned datasets into the project folder using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

5. **Version Control**  
   Uploaded the cleaned and organized project files to this GitHub repository.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Weka (for data cleaning)
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Git & GitHub (for version control)

## Future Work
- Implement data analysis or machine learning models
- Perform data visualization and result interpretation
- Expand dataset if required
